# The format
- Everyone will play everyone! You are responsible for schedule your match time with your friend.
- Each match will be scored as a set of tennis: Who get to 6 wins first will win.
- On the first game, rock-paper-sissor to see who play first, then alternate from there.
- Each game will go like this:
-- Person A gets to pick 3 numbers on A machine, and Person A will also choose to NOT play first.
-- Person B copies the 3 numbers to B machine, and Person B will choose to go first.
-- From there, A and B will copy each other moves to see which machine win!
-- Then Person B will get to pick the numbers on the next game, with Person A make the first move... and so on ...

# Strategy 
- Different machine will have different strength and weakness, so make sure to think hard to pick the numbers to your advantage.
