# The format
- Everyone will play everyone! You are responsible for schedule your match time with your friend.
- Each match will be scored as a set of tennis: Who get to 6 wins first will win.
- On the first game, rock-paper-sissor to see who play first, then alternate from there.
- Each game will go like this:
  - Person A gets to pick 3 numbers on machine A.
  - Person B copies the 3 numbers to machine B, and Person B will choose to first or second for machine B.
  - Then person A set the machine A to go second or first accordingly.
  - From there, A and B will copy each other moves to see which machine win!
  - After the game, then person B will take turn to pick the numbers and person A will choose whether to go first ... and so on ...

# Strategy 
- Different machines will have different strength and weakness, so make sure you think hard to pick the numbers to your advantage.
