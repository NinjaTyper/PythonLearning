This is the semester two schedule

All of us have been following Peter's Dad's curriculum, but now it is our turn to learn, and teach. Starting now, we are going to be having people do their own prepared presentations where they will be presenting and teaching the rest of us, a different person each week.
Since we have about 4-5 people in our group, we will be able to have about 3-6 weeks of planning for each person. Peter's dad will be assigning the topics for each person to each. The schedule is the following:

- Topic 1: Class/Object simple first topic 
  - Show your own demo program. Or you can upgrade your trivia game to have Trivia object and Question object.
  - Roy on Thursday 4/20
- Topic 2: Automation using pywinauto

Make a slideshow, and show as much information that you could find. Use google slides because it is free, and everyone can use it. Then use any recording software (Clipchamp is easy to learn), and record a video, then send it to our skype group so that everyone can watch it and learn, also so people who are not at the lesson can watch it. On the day of the session that you are going to be at, you will be presenting live, and do not need to show your video, you still need to turn in your video so the people in the other group can see it. The duedate of each presentation will be on the Wednesday of the week. https://www.google.com/slides/about/
