For Semester 2, we are going Presentation Style!

Each individual will be prompted to select a subject of interest from a list of suggestions or propose a new one. Subsequently, you'll schedule a date for your talk. The presentation will be recorded for friends who are unable to join. Following your presentation, you'll choose the next subject (or a continuation of your previous one) and set a date for it. With 5-6 participants, this allows for a comfortable rotation of one presentation per month per person.

The presentations are intended to be casual, emphasizing the learning aspect and sharing your newfound knowledge with friends, essentially "teaching" them. You can utilize PowerPoint or Google Slides (free) for your presentation. Keep in mind that I will be present to assist, and the primary goal is to enjoy sharing information with your friends. While attendance at every presentation isn't mandatory, you're encouraged to participate whenever possible. To stay updated with the group's knowledge base, it is essential to watch the recorded presentations.

- Topic 1: Class/Object simple first topic
