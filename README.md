![pythonfun](/pythonfun.jpg) 

# How?
- Learn by yourself: 
  - Basic: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python
  - Intermediate: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data
  - Other: https://www.py4e.com/lessons
- Use what you learnt to build something cool! then share with everyone.
- Help other friends to learn!

## Goals
- In 6 months, you will be to write automated tasks on your computer to do your "work" for you!
- In a year, you will be able to write simple AI program that uses your webcam to recognize your pet vs you!

## Lesson 1
In the first Lesson, we are going to be focusing on setting up the python environment, and learn about the basic input and output.

### Required Exercise for Lesson 1
1. The program will ask the user to enter "your name". Then it will say back "Hello <your name>"
2. The program will ask the user to enter a number, then it will print out a number that tripples that!
3. You will design temperature converter between Celcius and Farenheit! That's it, be creative and have fun!
    - Hint: your program can simply ask for temperature in Farenheit, then out put the result in Celcius. But it could do more that just that :wink:

### Bonus Exercise (optional)
1. You will design a currency converter program. Say you want to travel to Europe, and you want know how much your $100 USD is worth in â‚¬ Euro, etc ...

## Lesson 2
In Lesson 2, we will learn how to use the magic of python to solve some of the number problems that would have been difficult without the help of computers.
