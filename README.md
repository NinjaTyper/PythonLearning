# Python Fun
Let's learn Python together

![pythonfun](/pythonfun.jpg) 

# How?
- Learn by yourself: 
  - Basic: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python
  - Intermediate: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data
  - Other: https://www.py4e.com/lessons
- Use what you learnt to build something cool! then share with everyone.
- Help other friends to learn!

## Goals
- In 6 months, you will be to write automated tasks on your computer to do your "work" for you!
- In a year, you will be able to write simple AI program that uses your webcam to recognize your pet vs you!

## Lesson 1
In the first Lesson, we are going to be focusing on setting up the python environment, and learn about the basic input and output.

### Required Exercise for Lesson 1
1. The program will ask the user to enter "your name". Then it will say back "Hello <your name>"
2. The program will ask the user to enter a number, then it will print out a number that tripples that!
3. You will design temperature converter between Celcius and Farenheit! That's it, be creative and have fun!
    - Hint: your program can simply ask for temperature in Farenheit, then out put the result in Celcius. But it could do more that just that :wink:

### Bonus Exercise (optional)
1. You will design a currency converter program. Say you want to travel to Europe, and you want know how much your $100 USD is worth in â‚¬ Euro, etc ...

## Lesson 2
In Lesson 2, we will learn how to use the magic of python to solve some of the number problems that would have been difficult without the help of computers.
eg. What is the next prime number after 1 million/1,000,000

### Required Exercise for Lesson 2
1. The program will ask the user to enter a number, then it will print out all the number between 0 and that number.
2. The program will ask the user to enter a number, then it will print out "even" or "odd" by checking that number.
3. The program will ask the user to enter a number, then it will print out all the even number between 0 and that number.
4. The program will ask the user to enter a number, then it will check to see if that is a prime number or not.
5. The program will ask the user to enter a number, then it will print out all the prime number between 0 and that number.
6. Design a useful calculator! It's entirely up to you to build this calculator as you see fit. It could be as simple as adding 2 number, or it could be more complex to let the user choose to do normal operation (+-*/) or do some some fancy operation like "2 to the power of 3" or "5 factorial". The sky is the limit!

### Bonus Exercise (optional)
1. Say you have a secrete number (between 0 and 1000) in your head or written down somewhere. Design a program to ask a series of question to find out what that number is. The user can only answer "yes" or "no" to the questions. Example questions:
  - "Is that number larger than 900?"
  - "Is it a 2-digit number?"
  - "Is the last digit number even?"
  - "Is the number 125?"

## Lesson 3
In Lesson 3, we will learn about how strings work, how the text in coding works. You will learn about how to do string manipulation and have fun with it

Suggested material:
  -  https://www.py4e.com/lessons/strings
  
### Required Exercise for Lesson 3

1. Take in a string, then print out each character per line. Make sure to use 2 different of FOR loops and one using WHILE loop!
2. Experiment with ord(character) and chr(number)
2. Take in a string, build a simple encryption of that string
3. Now take in a encrypted string, then decrypt that string!
4. Build a tool to use to encrypt and decrypt text messages! Remember that user experience is important, and be creative!

### Bonus Exercise (optional)
1. Build a encryption/decryption tool that has a concept of a public key and a private key!
  
## Lesson 4
In Lesson 4, we will learn about how to store data in files, and read back and edit the files. This will help you store big projects into chunks, and each chunk will produce a data file.

### Required Exercise for Lesson 4

### Bonus Exercise (optional)

## Lesson 5
In Lesson 5, we will learn how to get data from the internet (social media, webpages, etc.)
